This project endeavors to employ the Cox Regression Model in the analysis of the Multi family loan portfolio obtained from Freddie Mac, with the primary objective of predicting loan default rates. The rationale behind selecting the Cox Regression Model lies in its widespread application in survival time analysis, facilitating the assessment of various factors' impact on survival time and the subsequent construction of a predictive model. In the context of this project, survival time corresponds to the duration of loans, while survival rate aligns with the probability of default (PD). The investigation aims to ascertain the efficacy of a traditional statistical model, such as the Cox Proportional Hazards Model, in predicting defaults within a dataset characterized by a substantial volume of loan-level information. This project seeks to contribute valuable insights into the predictive capabilities of the Cox Regression Model when applied to extensive loan-level data, establishing a benchmark against the logistic regression approach. The results are anticipated to inform risk assessment practices within the financial domain and enhance the understanding of predictive modeling in the context of credit risk.
